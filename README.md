# Divide And Conquer

## Inspiration
For people with anxiety, ADHD, depression, or other mental health struggles, finishing tasks can sometimes feel impossible. Projects at school or work may seem daunting, and the thought of even starting the task is often overwhelming. Most task manager apps and websites function in such a way that they show what needs to be done and when the tasks are due without much regard for how they should be completed. This method is not beneficial for everyone. Our website was inspired by the cognitive behavioral therapy technique of successive approximation, which encourages users to break down large tasks into smaller and more doable ones. This technique uses positive reinforcement as a reward to encourage task completion while also allowing users to build time and stress management skills. We built this website in the hopes that it can help people be more productive versions of themselves in any situation.

## What it does
Tasks and subtasks. Medals and positive statements.

The website allows users to input tasks and subtasks. The tasks do not need to have subtasks, but the user can create as many as they need in order to fully utilize the site. When a user completes a task, *********insert information about point values with tasks/subtasks*********.
